  This system is designed to generate bitweaver packages.

  The basic idea is that we should be able to declare a package
  using a YAML document and then use this document to generate
  a new bitweaver package.

  It is very much still a work in progress. See the TODO for things you can
  do to help out.

  As bleeding edge code, his generator currently requires using 
  the bitweaverpro code from tekimaki: http://github.com/tekimaki/bitweaverpro

running: >

  You can generate a sample package using the following:
    - ./generate.php pkg_sample.yaml

  This will create a folder with the name of the package which you
  can then place in your bitweaver install and load.
